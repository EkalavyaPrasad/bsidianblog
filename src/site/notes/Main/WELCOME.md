[[Journal/2024-12-02\|2024-12-02]] - The Beginning

I decided that I will start learning in public. I fully intend to publish my notes onto the internet so that it can benefit everyone. Documenting every thing is still something that resides outside my comfort zone. But I will try my best and provide best value to everything. 

# How I plan on doing this?

I am constantly building something, learning, growing evolving. This page shall be a place where I document everything. Hopefully everything works out how it is in my head currently. 

Dear reader, if you are reading this, thank you and please bear with me.
