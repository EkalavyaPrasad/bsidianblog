02/12/2024 - The Beginning

I decided that I will start learning in public. I fully intend to publish my notes onto the internet so that it can benefit everyone. Documenting every thing is still something that resides outside my comfort zone. But I will try my best and provide best value to everything. All my [[Main/Projects\|Projects]] building progress shall be documented here and all for you guys to enjoy ðŸ˜„. 

## How I plan on doing this?

I am constantly building something, learning, growing, evolving. This page shall be a place where I document everything. Hopefully everything works out how it is in my head currently. Also, as a personal philosophy, I will refrain from generating any AI text in this Blog. So just remember, all the texts in here, despite their flaws are 100% typed by me. 

Dear reader, if you are reading this, thank you and please bear with me.
