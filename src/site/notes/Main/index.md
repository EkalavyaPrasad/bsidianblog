02/12/2024 - The Beginning

I decided that I will start learning in public. I fully intend to publish my notes onto the internet so that it can benefit everyone. Documenting every thing is still something that resides outside my comfort zone. But I will try my best and provide best value to everything. All my [[Main/Projects\|Projects]] building progress shall be documented here and all for you guys to enjoy 😄. 

## How I plan on doing this?

I am constantly building something, learning, growing, evolving. This page shall be a place where I document everything. Hopefully everything works out how it is in my head currently. Also, as a personal philosophy, I will refrain from generating any AI text in this Blog. So just remember, all the texts in here, despite their flaws are 100% typed by me. 

Dear reader, if you are reading this, thank you and please bear with me.

## What is Obsidian?

All in all, it is a note taking app. Nothing special in itself, but what caught my eye was its customisability. Anyone who has a bit of coding know-how can tweak the code to do exactly what he/she wants to do. Also, the Obsidian community is extremely vast and ever-growing. These contributors can publish their own plug ins for the benefit of the common users. I started taking notes here a few days ago and even though it took me a good two to three days to set everything up according to my needs, I am pretty happy with how it turned out. I use this application to track my To-Do lists, jot down anything important, or even use it as a notebook for anything new. 

I have always been a note taker, I maintained notes for every new thing I learn and obsidian helps me do just that, all while enabling me to customise things according to my conveniences. 

## Why Obsidian?

Among all the pros, the biggest one for me is its ability to sync gracefully across all platforms. I am writing this paragraph from my mobile phone while cooking breakfast. I can rest assured that everything I write will get gracefully stored in my server and sync across all my devices. I can then proofread everything from my laptop later. It took me 30 mins to set up this blog, and publishing here is a matter of 3 clicks thanks to the Digital Garden Plugin [GitHub - oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden). From there, I can review, edit and modify anything on the go. 

My current setup makes recording my thoughts as seamless as possible. Even though it would be very simple to just generate prestine paragraphs programmatically, I really wanted to refrain from that to make this interaction with you, the reader, as personal as possible. There really isn't much of a system behind these words, its just pure, unfiltered thoughts. 

This app not only helps me publish, but also enables me to track my to-dos, track my habits and so on.

## What can you expect from this blog?

I will be very honest, there isn't much of a plan really. It's main goal is to serve as a log of my projects so that I can present a behind the scenes view of how I make my projects. Also, I want to be able to properly set targets for myself and let people see how I do things. Each project section will also have a notes section that will contain all the resources I use to learn and build, this can't take place of proper guided learning but can serve as a blueprint for anyone that wants to do what I do. 

I am not an expert in anything, but who says you have to be an expert to share knowledge, with this thought, lets dive right in....
