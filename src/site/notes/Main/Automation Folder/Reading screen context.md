## How to read Screen Contents with python?

I remember seeing a video from a very well-known content creator named [Sentdex](https://www.youtube.com/@sentdex).  In a video of his, he created a neural network that drives vehicles in a game called GTA V using convolutional neural networks. 

Why is that important? well, it's not. But the initial few videos are concentrated on getting a live feed of the screen in python. (For those who are curious, here is the [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ks4MPfMq8aQ&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDeETZEOy4VdocT7TOjfSA8a&ab_channel=sentdex) ).
