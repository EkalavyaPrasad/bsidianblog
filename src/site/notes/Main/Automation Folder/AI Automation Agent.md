### The Idea....

I saw this video from Anthropic AI. 

<iframe title="Claude | Computer use for automating operations" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ODaHJzOyVCQ?feature=oembed" height="113" width="200" allowfullscreen="" allow="fullscreen" style="aspect-ratio: 1.76991 / 1; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe>

Honestly, it blew my mind. I was really impressed by the capabilities of the model and the things it could do. 

My reaction, *I want to make something like this.*

### My vision

To create an AI agent that constantly reads the screen and its contents. Take in the tasks that the user wants it to do, list the steps that needs to be taken to complete said tasks and do it. 

There are 3 main things that I have to do. 

- Make sure that my screen is recorded and sent to the program. 
- Being able to Click and type anything on command. 
- Building an AI system that:
	- Lists, step by step how to complete task at hand. 
	- Break down the steps to their most basic version. 
	- Execute them. 

This one will be a complex one. But let's see where things go. 


Up next, Creating a program that can see the contents of my screen.
