# Equity chatbot assistant

The vision behind this chatbot is ease of access. 



After the base vision is set, I wanted to build my [[Interface & Schedule\|Interface & Schedule]]. 

Maintaining a [[Main/Equity chatbot folder/Devlog\|Devlog]] is also crucial to properly document my step by step workings, bug-fixes, etc. 

Lastly, my notes provide a proper documentation of my learnings. I will paste all my resources that I use to build my project or learn a particular concept.
