## Vision Behind the Project

The vision behind this chatbot is ease of access. 

Here 's what I have in mind. Build a tool that enables the user to input their portfolio and get a very organised dashboard that tells them the quality of their portfolio. Additionally, an AI agent shall prepare a customised portfolio report for them. For me, it will be a simple way to showcase my ability to code and built AI models. 

### What I want to learn along the way?

Personally, I have a pretty good idea about how I want to go about this project. A blueprint is set in my mind and I know how things are to be done. However, I want to dip my toes into proper equity analysis and how to build a comprehensive report using python. I have built numerous dashboards on tools like Excel but not on python. Also, it will be an outside the comfort zone on building something front-end. 

After the base vision is set, I wanted to build my [[Main/Equity chatbot folder/Interface\|Interface]]. 

Maintaining a [[Main/Equity chatbot folder/Devlog\|Devlog]] is also crucial to properly document my step by step workings, bug-fixes, etc. 

Lastly, my notes provide a proper documentation of my learnings. I will paste all my resources that I use to build my project or learn a particular concept. 

Now that we have all that out of the way, let's dive in.
